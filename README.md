In this implementation we try to display sin, cos and tan graphs ​​of a variable on the board in STM Studio app and using Arm Keil MDK and STM32Cube MX.

To do this, we set the variable equal to zero, then increase its value regularly and store the new sin, cos and tan values ​​in three other variables.
